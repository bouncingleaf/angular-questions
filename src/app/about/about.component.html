    About the questions application
  </h3>
  <p>
    This app was originally based on the application built during the Pluralsight course
    "<a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-express-full-stack-app-building">
      Building a full stack app with React and Express
    </a>".
  </p>
  <p>
    My intent was to just go through the tutorial, pick up the information about how to connect the front and back end, maybe learn a little about authentication, and then move on.
  I really should have known that I was a) going to love learning React too much to give that up, and b) going to run into some completely bizarre bugs that would derail me for several days.

  <p>
    So, starting on 5/4/2019, I just rewrote it in Angular.
