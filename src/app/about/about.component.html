    About the questions application
  </h3>
  <p>
    This app was originally based on the application built during the Pluralsight course
    "<a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-express-full-stack-app-building">
      Building a full stack app with React and Express</a>". But I started getting mired in problems I wasn't sure how to fix.
  </p>
  <p>
      Eventually I gave up and rewrote the entire application in Angular over the course of the weekend.
